-- Transaction is a group of SQL statements
-- that represent a single unit of work

-- All statements must complete successfully,
-- otherwise the transaction will fail

Transaction ACID properties
	* Atomicity - single unit, no matter how many statements a transaction has
    Either they all fail or they all succceed
    * Consistency
    * Isolation - can not change same rows at the same time, only one transaction can run at once
    * Durability - Once a transaction is complete, the data is committed
