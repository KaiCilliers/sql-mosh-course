INNER JOIN
	Combine two tables based on certain columns, like an ID
	Orders table(tbl_1) and customer table(tbl_2)
	It is possible to have 80 customers, but only 20 orders
	The result would only be 20 records
	SELECT *
	FROM tbl_1
	JOIN tbl_2...
OUTER JOINS
	LEFT
	would be 20 records (amount of orders)
	RIGHT
	would be 80 records (amount of customers)

UNION
-- Combine results from multiple Queries
-- Results will be added as new rows
-- The column amount has to be equal of each table
-- Column name is from tbl_1's column
SELECT first_name
FROM customers -- better example table is archived_orders
UNION
SELECT name
FROM shippers -- better example table is orders
