Indexes are stored in memory

Indexes cost
incresase the database size
slow down the writes
	after each write (insert, delete, update) it has to update indexes

Reserve indexes for performance critical queries
Design indexes based on your queries, not your tables

Internally indexes are stored in a binary tree

Some basic rule of thumbs using indexes for sorting (ORDER BY)
	if you have columns a and b (a, b) and they are a composite index (a, b)
	you can sort by
		a
		a, b
		a DESC, b DESC
	you can not mix the directions
	you can not add a third column (a, c, b)
	you can sort by column b, but that has some restrictions, see related script about sorting

	Some guidelines on choosing what to include in an index
		look at all your 'where' clauses
			look at the columns that appear most frequently
		look at the columns in your 'order by' statements
			try to include those fields
		look at the columns used in the 'select' clause
			try to include those fields (which makes it a covering index)
