Indexes are stored in memory

Indexes cost
incresase the database size
slow down the writes
	after each write (insert, delete, update) it has to update indexes

Reserve indexes for performance critical queries
Design indexes based on your queries, not your tables

Internally indexes are stored in a binary tree
