Indexes are stored in memory

Indexes cost
incresase the database size
slow down the writes
	after each write (insert, delete, update) it has to update indexes

Reserve indexes for performance critical queries
Design indexes based on your queries, not your tables

Internally indexes are stored in a binary tree

Some basic rule of thumbs using indexes for sorting (ORDER BY)
	if you have columns a and b (a, b) and they are a composite index (a, b)
	you can sort by
		a
		a, b
		a DESC, b DESC
	you can not mix the directions
	you can not add a third column (a, c, b)
	you can sort by column b, but that has some restrictions, see related script about sorting
