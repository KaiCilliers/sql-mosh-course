Priority Order of logical operators
	AND
	OR

What happens when you apply the NOT operator to the following statement?
	WHERE (birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000)

> turns into <=
OR turns into AND
> turns into <=
NOT (birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000) === WHERE (birth_date <= '1990-01-01' AND points <= 1000)

REGEXP
^ indicates the start of a string
$ indicates the end of a string
| indicates an 'or'
	'field|mac' === a string that contains 'field' or 'mac'
WHERE last_name REGEXP '[gim]e' -- lastname containing 'ge' or 'ie' or 'me'
WHERE last_name REGEXP '[a-h]e' -- range from a to h (no need to type a,b,c,d...)
