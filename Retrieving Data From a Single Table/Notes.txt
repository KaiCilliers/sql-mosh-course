Priority Order of logical operators
	AND
	OR

What happens when you apply the NOT operator to the following statement?
	WHERE (birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000)

> turns into <=
OR turns into AND
> turns into <=
NOT (birth_date > '1990-01-01' OR points > 1000) === WHERE (birth_date <= '1990-01-01' AND points <= 1000)

REGEXP
^ indicates the start of a string
$ indicates the end of a string
| indicates an 'or'
	'field|mac' === a string that contains 'field' or 'mac'
WHERE last_name REGEXP '[gim]e' -- lastname containing 'ge' or 'ie' or 'me'
WHERE last_name REGEXP '[a-h]e' -- range from a to h (no need to type a,b,c,d...)

-- ^ beginning
-- $ end
-- | logical or
-- [abcd]
-- [a-f]

LIMIT clause with an offset
3 records per page
	page 1: 1 - 3
	page 2: 4 - 6
	page 3: 7 - 9
===
SELECT * FROM my_table LIMIT 6, 3
	this will skip records 1 to 6 and return record number 7, 8, and 9
